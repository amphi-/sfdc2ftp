1. Overview

The middleware is written in NodeJS v0.12.7 using the Express.js 4 framework. The middleware receives data from salesforce via JSON POST, converts the data into a CSV file (Windows-1252 encoded). This file will be uploaded to the desired customer FTP. The middleware will be triggered by a Apex script written on salesforce side.
